## gists ?
> GitHub gists provide a simple way to share code snippets with others. Every gist is a Git repository, which means that it can be forked and cloned.

> gist, which lets you store and distribute code snippets without setting up a full-fledged git repository

> If you are signed in to GitHub when you create a gist, the gist will be associated with your account and you will see it in your list of gists when you navigate to your [gist home page](https://gist.github.com/).

> Since gists are Git repositories, you can view their full commit history, complete with diffs. You can also fork or clone gists 

> You can download a ZIP file of a gist by clicking the Download ZIP button at the top of the gist.

### gists can be public or secret

* Public gists show up in [Discover](https://gist.github.com/discover), where people can browse new gists as they're created. They're also searchable, so you can use them if you'd like other people to find and see your work.

* Secret gists don't show up in [Discover](https://gist.github.com/discover) and are not searchable unless you are logged in and are the author of the secret gist. Secret gists aren't private. If you send the URL of a secret gist to a friend, they'll be able to see it. However, if someone you don't know discovers the URL, they'll also be able to see your gist. If you need to keep your code away from prying eyes, you may want to create a private repository instead.
