# GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) service that allows developers to automate workflows directly within their GitHub repositories. It helps automate software development processes such as building, testing, and deploying code.

## Key Features
- **Workflow Automation**: Define custom workflows using YAML syntax.
- **Event-Driven**: Trigger workflows based on GitHub events (e.g., push, pull request, issue creation).
- **Job Orchestration**: Define multiple jobs that run sequentially or in parallel.
- **Self-Hosted Runners**: Execute workflows on custom machines.
- **Integration with GitHub**: Deep integration with repositories, issues, and pull requests.

## Components of GitHub Actions
- **Workflows**: YAML configuration files that define the automation process.
- **Events**: Triggers that start a workflow (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`).
- **Jobs**: A collection of steps executed on a runner.
- **Steps**: Individual tasks within a job.
- **Actions**: Predefined reusable components to perform common tasks.
- **Runners**: Virtual environments where workflows run.

## Benefits
- Automates repetitive tasks.
- Improves CI/CD processes.
- Enhances collaboration.
- Supports multiple programming languages and environments.

## Workflow Structure
A GitHub Actions workflow is defined in a YAML file inside the `.github/workflows/` directory of a repository. The workflow consists of:

### Example Workflow
```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
      
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
```
